<h3>The Need</h3>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;">GTAJava founders realized that
their frustrations with other Job hunting websites presented them with a
compelling market opportunity. Here was a chance to make the world a
smaller place - by creating a simple, free, fast service that lets
everyone everywhere to communicate using rich media in real time. And
not only would GTAJava be easy to use, it would also be one of the first
site to provide a new feature called Job Orchestration and Instant
Training combined with innovative eLearning and Communication
methodologies. </span>
<p></p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> After having been on both side of fence for as nearly as
10 years , the founders have realized the pain during recruitment
process is collateral , its <b>almost as difficult to recruit as to get
recruited</b>. The cost & time in recruiting a potential employee is
substantial. ( Sometimes as high as 30% of the salary ). Out of every 4
employee presented with a job offer 3 are likely to turn down. </span>
<p></p>
<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> As far as Job hunters are concerned, even though they might match 90% of the skills required for the job
they might lack in few technical aspects. Its often difficult to get Hands on training on those aspects. This new and innovative way helps them to get
trained easily in quick and secure manner. </span>
